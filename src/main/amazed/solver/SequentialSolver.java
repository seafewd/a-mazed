/**
 * <code>SequentialSolver</code> implements a solver for
 * <code>Maze</code> objects using a single-thread depth-first search.
 * <p>
 * Even though <code>SequentialSolver</code> is implemented as a
 * <code>RecursiveTask</code>, it is purely sequential. Method
 * <code>compute</code> returns a solution consisting of a list of
 * node identifiers in the maze that lead from the start node to a
 * goal.
 * <p>
 * Depth-first search is implemented using a stack of
 * <code>frontier</code> nodes &mdash; giving the nodes to be explored
 * next in depth-first order. Visited nodes are added to a set
 * <code>visited</code>. For each visited node,
 * <code>predecessor</code> keeps track of the other node adjacent to
 * the visited node that has been visited just before it. Method
 * <code>pathFromTo</code> reconstructs a path by following the
 * <code>precedessor</code> relation backwards.
